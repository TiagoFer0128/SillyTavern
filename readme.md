# SillyTavern

### Brought to you by @SillyLossy and @RossAscends

### What is SillyTavern or TavernAI?
Tavern is a user interface you can install on your computer (and Android phones) that allows you to interact text generation AIs and chat/roleplay with characters you or the community create.

SillyTavern is a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8 which is under more active development, and has added many major features. At this point they can be thought of as completely independent programs.


### What do I need other than Tavern?
On its own Tavern is useless, as it's just a user interface. You have to have access to an AI system backend that can act as the roleplay character. There are various supported backends: OpenAPI API (GPT), KoboldAI (either running locally or on Google Colab), and more.

### I'm new to all this. I just want to have a good time easily. What is the best AI backend to use?
The most advanced/intelligent AI backend for roleplaying is to pay for OpenAI's GPT API. It's also among the easiest to use. Objectively, GPT is streets ahead of all other backends. However, OpenAI log all your activity, and your account MAY be banned in the future if you violate their policies (e.g. on adult content). However, there are no reports of anyone being banned yet.
People who value privacy more tend to run a self-hosted AI backend like KoboldAI. Self-hosted backends do not log, but they are much less capable at roleplaying.

### Do I need a powerful PC to run Tavern?**
Since Tavern is only a user interface, it has tiny hardware requirements, it will run on anything. It's the AI system backend that needs to be powerful.

### I want to try self-hosted easily. Got a Google Colab?

Try on Colab (runs KoboldAI backend and TavernAI Extras server alongside):  <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/SillyLossy/TavernAI-extras/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb">

## UI/CSS/Quality of Life tweaks by RossAscends

* Mobile-friendly page design
* HotKeys

  * Ctrl+Left = view locally stored variables (in the browser console window)
  * Ctrl+Enter = Regenerate last AI response.

* User Name Changes and Character Deletion no longer force the page to refresh.

* Toggle option to automatically connect to API on page load.

* Clicking the Lock on the nav panel will hold the panel open, and this setting be remembered across sessions.
* Nav panel status of open or closed will also be saved across sessions.

* mobile UI optimized for iOS, and supports saving a shortcut to iOS homescreen and opening in fullscreen mode.

## Installation

*NOTE: This branch is intended for local install purposes, and has not been tested on a colab or other cloud notebook service.*

  1. install [NodeJS](nodejs.org)
  2. download the zip from this github repo
  3. unzip it into a folder of your choice
  4. run start.bat via double clicking or in a command line.
  5. Once the server has prepared everything for you, it will open a tab in your browser.

## Remote connections

Most often this is for people who want use TAI on their mobile phones while at home.
If you want to enable other devices to connect to your TAI server, open 'config.conf' in a text editor, and change: 

```
const whitelistMode = true;
```
to 
```
const whitelistMode = false;
```
Save the file. 
Restart your TAI server. 

You will now be able to connect from other devices. 

***Disclaimer: Anyone else who knows your IP address and TAI port number will be able to as well***

To connect over wifi you'll need your PC's local wifi IP address 
  - (For Windows: windows button > type 'cmd.exe' in the search bar> type 'ipconfig' in the console, hit Enter > "IPv4" listing)
if you want other people on the internet to connect, and check [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) for 'IPv4'

## Performance issues?
