                <h2>World Info</h2>
                <h4>World Info enhances AI's understanding of the details in your world.</h4>
                <p>It functions like a dynamic dictionary that only inserts relevant information from World Info entries when keywords associated with the entries are present in the message text.</p>
                <p>The TavernAI engine activates and seamlessly integrates the appropriate lore into the prompt, providing background information to the AI.</p>
                <p><i>It is important to note that while World Info helps guide the AI towards your desired lore, it does not guarantee its appearance in the generated output messages.</i></p>
                
                <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The AI does not insert keywords into context, so each World Info entry should be a comprehensive, standalone description.</li>
                    <li>To create a rich and detailed world lore, entries can be interlinked and reference one another.</li>
                    <li>To conserve tokens, it is advisable to keep entry contents concise, with a general recommended limit of 50 tokens per entry.</li>
                </ul>
