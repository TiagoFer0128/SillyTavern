                <h2>Soft Prompts</h2>
                <h4>Soft Prompts allow you to customize the style and behavior of your AI.</h4>
                <p>
                    They are created by training the AI with a special type of prompt using a collection of input data.
                    Experimenting with different soft prompts can lead to exciting and unique results.
                    The most successful soft prompts are those that align the AI's output with a literary genre, fictional universe, or the style of a particular author.

                <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Soft prompts do not provide new information to the model, but can effectively influence the model's tone, word choice, and formatting.</li>
                    <li>Soft prompts are not a means of compressing a full prompt into a limited token space. Instead, they provide a way to guide the language model's output through data in the context.</li>
