            <h2>Anchors</h2>
            <p>
                Anchors are used to increase the length of messages.<br>
                There are two types of anchors: <u>Character Anchor</u> and <u>Style Anchor</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Character Anchor</u> - affects the character played by the AI by motivating it to write longer
                messages.<br><br>
                Looks like:
                <code>[Elaborate speaker]</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Style Anchor</u> - affects the entire AI model, motivating the AI to write longer messages even when
                it is not acting as the character.<Br><br>
                Looks like:
                <code>[Writing style: very long messages]</code>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Anchors Order sets the location of anchors in the promt, the first anchor in the order is much further
                back in the context and thus has less influence than second.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second anchor is only turned on after 8-12 messages, because when the chat still only has a few
                messages, the first anchor creates enough effect on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes an AI model may not perceive anchors correctly or the AI model already generates sufficiently
                long messages.
                For these cases, you can disable the anchors by unchecking their respective boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>When using Pygmalion models these anchors are automatically disabled, since Pygmalion already
                    generates long enough messages.</u>
