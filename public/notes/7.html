            <h3>Repetition penalty</h3>
            <p>
                Repetition penalty is responsible for the penalty of repeated words. <br>
                If the character is fixated on something or repeats the same phrase, then increasing this parameter will
                fix it. <br>
                It is not recommended to increase this parameter too much for the chat format, as it may break this
                format. <br>
                <b>The standard value for chat is approximately 1.0 - 1.05</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Repetition penalty range</h3>
            <p>
                The range of influence of Repetition penalty in tokens.
