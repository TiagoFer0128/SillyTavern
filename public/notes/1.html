            <h2>Character description</h2>
            <p>
                Used to add the character description and the rest that the AI should know.<br><br>
                For example, you can add information about the world in which the action takes place and describe
                the characteristics for the character you are playing for.<br><br>
                Usually it all takes 200-350 tokens.
            </p>
            <h3>Methods and format</h3>
            <p>
                For most Kobold's models the easiest way is to use a free form for description, and in each sentence it
                is desirable to specify the name of the character.<br><br>
                The entire description should be in one line without hyphenation.<br><br>
                For example:<br><br>
                <code>
                    Chloe is a female elf. Chloe wears black-white maid dress with green collar and red glasses. Chloe has medium length black hair. Chloe's personality is...
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                But that the AI would be less confused the best way is to use the W++ format.<Br><br>
